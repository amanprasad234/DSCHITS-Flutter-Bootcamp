# DSCHITS-Flutter-Bootcamp
______________________________________
Welcome to Flutter Bootcamp by DSC HITS. During the 6 weeks bootcamp you will be taking up a challenge.

The challenge will require you to commit to your project repository. Each day you will commit something new you learned to build a beautiful looking app. We donot specify what to make. It can be anything. But we don't expect a fully fledged app.

Some examples which you can try are,
1. Image Gallery
2. Quotes App
3. Clock

Please feel free to fork this repo and start your challenge
