# DSCHITS-Flutter-Bootcamp
______________________________________
Welcome to Flutter Bootcamp by DSC HITS. During the 6 weeks bootcamp you will be taking up a challenge.

The challenge will require you to commit to your project repository. We require you to build an app within these 6 weeks and show us your creation!

Some examples which you can try are,
1. Image Gallery
2. Quotes App
3. Clock
4. Or your portfolio itself

Please feel free to fork this repo and start your challenge. The template folder is just a folder with some files for illustration. This is how you will commit to the forked repository.
