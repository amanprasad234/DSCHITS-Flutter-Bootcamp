# DSCHITS-Flutter-Bootcamp
______________________________________
Welcome to Flutter Bootcamp by DSC HITS. During the 6 weeks bootcamp you will be taking up a challenge.

The challenge will require you to commit to your project repository. Each day you will commit something new you learned to build a beautiful looking app. We donot specify what to make. It can be anything. But we don't expect a fully fledged app.

Some examples which you can try are,
1. Image Gallery
2. Quotes App
3. Clock

Please feel free to fork this repo and start your challenge. The template folder is just a folder with some files for illustration. This is how you will commit to the forked repository.
